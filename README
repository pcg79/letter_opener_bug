In letter_opener (https://github.com/ryanb/letter_opener) version 0.0.2 there exists a bug in which calling deliver! (instead of deliver) causes no email to open in your browser and produces this error in your log:

NoMethodError (undefined method `settings' for #<LetterOpener::DeliveryMethod:0x000001036b5ba8>):
  app/controllers/users_controller.rb:3:in `new'
